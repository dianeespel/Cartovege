# Cartovege

The SCO-Cartovege project developed a decision support tool for the conservation of flora and habitats of subantarctic islands, by combining vegetation surveys, satellite imagery and artificial intelligence modeling. The developed remote sensing R pipeline can be transferred to others territories. 

### **Cartovege** üåø
_Automated pipeline for very high-resolution habitat mapping in remote environments_

Cartovege is an end-to-end, fully scripted pipeline developed in R to produce high-resolution habitat and vegetation maps from remote sensing data, with minimal human intervention.

Originally developed to address the challenges of mapping in isolated, cloud-prone insular regions (e.g., French subantarctic islands), the pipeline integrates:
- Orthorectified multispectral imagery
- Digital elevation model
- Vector mask of region of interest
- Field habitat data (in situ and/or photo-interpreted)

It uses a **Random Forest** supervised classification framework and supports hierarchical habitat typologies (up to _N_ levels) and the calculation of landscape metrics and diversity indices for ecological monitoring.

üõ†Ô∏è Key features

- Fully automated and reproducible workflow
- Adaptable to various datasets, spatial resolutions, and ecological contexts
- Transparent script-based implementation (no GUI required)
- RMarkdown tutorials
